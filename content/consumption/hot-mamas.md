It's yummy. They are open til 11 or midnight depending on the day, and they have good, consistent, fast pizza. My favorites are the chef's choice and the pesto. The chef's choice is margherita add mushrooms and garlic. The pesto is just mozzarella, pesto, and feta, and it is scrumptious. If anything I wish it had a little more pesto. I like getting tons of red pepper flakes and herbs at the counter. They have some of the most affordable pizza on the hill. The tables outside on the corner of Boylston and Pine are really lovely. I thoroughly enjoy sitting at them on a sunny day and watching the world go by. It is a relatively busy corner, so there is so much to see, and it makes me feel very integrated in it all. I once saw a youtube video which called this the best pizza in seattle, and I am sure that is not true, but it's yummy.
