This is a quick and delightful read. In trying to explain it to a friend today, I called it magical realism, which I suppose isn't false. This is a book that is more focused on broad strokes of vibes than anything else. It is technically about a woman and her adopted son living in medieval London. The author has a real knack for imagery, and I found myself impressed with how far from cliche many of the descriptions were. I do kind of care about this book a lot, even though I find myself holding it in my mind lightly. I care about it because I once received the feedback that I write about my life as if the present and the future and the past are indistinguishable, and that is what this book is really about. It is about the endurance of spirit, the familiarity of humanity, and the places our gazes go when they don't land in the room we're in. It is worth a read.
